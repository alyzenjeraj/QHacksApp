## Inspiration
While pooling together our ideas, we discovered that we had one thing in common, 
a passion for arts. We all missed being able to work on our projects and showcase them to each other in person, 
especially when we were losing motivation to just create art for ourselves.

We wanted to design a platform that could be used by people all anywhere 
in the world to help out each other, get inspiration, and just have a bit of fun with their art.

## What it does
Finch is a mobile app that allows users to match with other people of the same interest 
with the intent of swapping art.  Users can look at other people's profiles, match with them if they want
to do an art swap, or just enjoy looking at other people's creativity. 

## How we built it
We used React-Native and Node.js to create the app. To test and debug, we used an android emulator.

## Challenges we ran into
Nobody on the team has any previous app-dev, web-dev, or Javascript experience so it was 
a struggle to get started. We spent at least 4-5 hours just trying to get our computers set up correctly 
to run React-Native and Node.js. Trying to learn a new language in 48 hours is no easy feat, finding good 
tutorials and understanding syntax took a *lot* of work, but we all feel that we really did learn a LOT. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the over design and UI. When everything was finally put together it was insane to see 
how much we were able to get done. We feel like we have unlocked a whole new toolset 
and cannot wait to keep using everything we learned. 

## What we learned
Always set up your software environments before hacking starts! Also a TON TON TON about app development - it's not nearly as scary anymore. 

## What's next for Finch
The backend was not fully developed, the current prototype is not actually capable of creating 
accounts so that's the obvious next step. We definitely want to implement functions for people to
message each other when they connect. Also adding capabilities to filter who you are looking at with 
interest tags and searching. Another thing we really want to do is make the app look nicer. We did a 
pretty bare-bones approach because of the time constraints but an app about art should look pretty too!
